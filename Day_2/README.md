For today, you have a few options on what to work on for code challenge practice:
* Two Sum: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
* Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
* Implement a Queue with Stacks: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/
You can also opt to work on the other linked list problems in the HackerRank Interview Prep Guide. All practice is good practice, so we'll leave it at your discretion as far as what specifically you'd like to work on.
